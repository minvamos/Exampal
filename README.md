**ExamPal** is a chatbot project designed to generate 8 exam questions based on user-provided content. The name "ExamPal" incorporates a clever wordplay: "Pal" refers to the Korean pronunciation of the number 8 (íŒ”, "pal"), while also meaning "friend" in English. Thus, ExamPal symbolizes a friend that helps you generate 8 exam questions.
